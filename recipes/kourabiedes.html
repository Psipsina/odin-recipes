    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C set to fan</li>
        <li>In a mixer’s bowl add the butter, the icing sugar, and beat with the paddle attachment at high speed, for 10-15 minutes, until the mixture is fluffy and white.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla powder, the rosewater, the bitter almond liqueur, and keep beating. Remove the bowl from the mixer. </li>
        <li>Break down the almond slivers with your hands, in order to crumble them, and add them to a bowl. Add the flour, the salt, and put them in the mixer’s bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix the mixture with a serving spoon, very softly so that it does not lose its volume. As soon as the ingredients are homogenized, mix with your hands.</li>
        <li>Shape balls, 30 g each, and transfer to a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Lightly press the center with your finger and bake for 20-25 minutes. Follow the same process for the whole mixture.</li>
        <li> Put a layer of the almond snowballs on a serving platter, spray with rosewater, and dust with icing sugar. Follow the same process for all of the snowballs and serve.</li>
   </ol>
